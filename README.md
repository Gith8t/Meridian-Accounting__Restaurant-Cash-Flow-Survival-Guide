**## Why 13 Weeks?**

### The Restaurant Cash Reality Check

**Your P&L Says:** "Congrats! 8% profit last month!"  
**Your Bank Says:** "NSF fee: $35"  
**The Problem:** Timing kills more restaurants than bad food

### Why 13 Weeks Works
- **Too Short (Monthly):** Hides the rent + payroll collision
- **Too Long (Annual):** Can't react fast enough
- **Just Right (13 Weeks):** See problems 3 weeks early

### The Timing Disasters Monthly Views Hide
```
Week 1: Rent ($8,000) + Insurance ($1,200) = -$9,200
Week 2: Payroll ($12,000) + Sales Tax ($3,000) = -$15,000
Week 3: Normal week = +$2,000
Week 4: Normal week = +$2,000

Monthly P&L: "You made money!"
Week 2 Reality: "Can't make payroll"
```

## Setting Up Your Forecast

### The Foundation: Know Your True Starting Position

```
WHAT THE BANK SAYS VS. WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE

Bank Balance:                    $32,456
Less:
- Uncleared checks:             ($3,234)
- Pending auto-drafts:          ($1,890)
- CC tips owed tonight:         ($1,200)

Plus:
- CC deposits in transit:        $8,945
- Weekend deposits pending:      $4,234
- Delivery apps receivable:     $12,450

TRUE AVAILABLE CASH:            $51,761

But wait...
- Payroll in 3 days:           ($18,000)
- COD orders tomorrow:          ($3,500)
- Rent due in 5 days:          ($8,000)

REAL BREATHING ROOM:            $22,261
Days of cash: 11 (YELLOW ALERT)
```

### Revenue Categories That Matter

Don't just track "sales" - track WHEN you get paid:

1. **Dine-in Cash:** Same day (100%)
2. **Dine-in Credit:** +2-3 days (minus 2.5% fees)
3. **Delivery Apps:** +7-21 days (minus 15-30%)
4. **Catering:** 50% deposit, 50% maybe
5. **Gift Cards:** Cash today, food cost later
6. **Private Events:** Deposit... if you're lucky

## Revenue Projections That Match Reality

### Daily Sales Patterns (Stop Using Averages!)

```
YOUR WEEKLY REALITY CHECK:
Monday:    $2,800 (70% of average) ← Slow, order light
Tuesday:   $3,200 (80% of average) ← Building momentum  
Wednesday: $3,600 (90% of average) ← Steady
Thursday:  $3,800 (95% of average) ← Pre-weekend prep
Friday:    $5,200 (130% of average) ← Biggest tip night
Saturday:  $5,600 (140% of average) ← Pray nothing breaks
Sunday:    $3,800 (95% of average) ← Brunch saves you

Weekly:    $28,000
But daily cash needs don't care about weekly totals!
```

### Seasonal Reality Adjustments

**Fine Dining Truth:**
```
January:   Dead (0.80x) - Everyone's on diets
February:  Better (0.85x) - Valentine's saves you  
March:     Building (0.95x) - Spring hope
April:     Good (1.00x) - Normalized
May:       Great (1.10x) - Graduations
June:      Wedding season (1.15x)
July:      Tourist death (0.85x) - They're at the beach
August:    Still dead (0.85x)
September: Recovery (1.00x) - Back to school
October:   Solid (1.05x) - Date nights return
November:  Party time (1.15x) - Holiday parties
December:  Make your year (1.25x) - Or die trying
```

**Quick Service/Fast Casual:**
```
More stable BUT:
- School in session: +20% lunch
- School out: -30% lunch
- Game days: +40% (sports bars)
- Construction season: +25% breakfast
- WFH Fridays: -20% lunch
```

### Holiday Impact Calculator

```
HOLIDAYS THAT KILL YOU:
- July 4th: -50% (Everyone's grilling)
- Thanksgiving: -80% (Just close)
- Christmas Eve: Depends on concept
- Super Bowl: +60% (sports bars only)

HOLIDAYS THAT SAVE YOU:
- Valentine's Day: +50% (book out)
- Mother's Day: +60% (your biggest day)
- NYE: +100% (if you price it right)
- St. Patrick's: +40% (bars only)
```

## Operating Disbursements (The Real Story)

### Credit Card Processing: The Hidden Float

**What Actually Happens to Your Money:**
```
FRIDAY NIGHT REALITY:
Sales: $8,000
Credit Cards: $7,200 (90%)
Cash: $800 (10%)

When you ACTUALLY get the money:
- Visa/MC batch: Closes 2am Saturday
- Hits bank: Tuesday afternoon (+3 days)
- Amex batch: Separate submission
- Hits bank: Thursday (+5 days)
- Weekend = +2 more days always

The Float Math:
Weekend CC sales: $22,000
Cash in bank Tuesday: $0
Your problem: Payroll is Monday
```

### Delivery App Payment Purgatory

```
THE PAINFUL TRUTH:
Weekly Delivery Sales: $10,000

DoorDash (40%): $4,000

Uber Eats (35%): $3,500  
- Payment: 2x weekly (10 days behind)

- Refunds: Deducted immediately

Grubhub (25%): $2,500

- Dec 15: Receive $6,000 (after fees)
- Dec 22: Receive $3,000
- Dec 29: Still waiting on $1,000
- Cash lag: Kills January payroll
```

```
WHO GETS PAID WHEN (AND HOW MAD THEY GET)

NEVER DELAY:

## Payroll & Tips: The Cash Drain

### The Daily Tip Crisis No One Talks About

```
THE FRIDAY NIGHT TIP DISASTER

It's 11 PM. Your servers are tired. They want their money.

Total sales: $12,000
Credit card sales: $10,800 (90%)
Credit card tips: $2,160
Cash sales: $1,200
Cash tips: $240

Total tips earned: $2,400

But here's your problem:
Cash in register: $1,200
Tips owed: $2,400
SHORTFALL: $1,200

You need $1,200 cash RIGHT NOW or servers walk.
The $10,800 in credit cards? See you Tuesday.

THIS IS WHY RESTAURANTS FAIL.
```

### Server Checkout Reality Sheet

```
SARAH'S FRIDAY CHECKOUT (One of Eight Servers)

Sales Breakdown:
Total Sales:                  $2,456.00
- Cash Sales:                 $234.00
- Credit Sales:               $2,222.00

Tips Earned:
Cash Tips:                    $46.80
Credit Tips:                  $444.40
Total Tips:                   $491.20

Tip Share Out (20%):          ($98.24)
- Busser pool:                $49.12
- Bar pool:                   $24.56  
- Host pool:                  $24.56

NET TIPS DUE SARAH:           $392.96

Cash Sarah Has:
Cash Sales + Cash Tips:       $280.80

House Owes Sarah:             $392.96
Sarah Gives House:            $280.80
HOUSE PAYS SARAH:             $112.16 CASH

Multiply by 8 servers = $897.28 cash needed NOW
But you only have $400 in cash sales...
```

### The Payroll Tax Bomb

```
WHAT PAYROLL REALLY COSTS (Nobody Tells You This)

Posted Wage: $15/hour
What You Actually Pay:

Base Wage:              $15.00
Employer FICA (7.65%):  $1.15
Medicare (1.45%):       $0.22
Federal Unemployment:    $0.09
State Unemployment:      $0.81
Workers Comp (4.2%):    $0.63
---------------------------------
TRUE HOURLY COST:       $17.90 (+19.3%)

For Tipped Employees ($2.13/hour):
Looks cheap until...
- Overtime = Full minimum wage
- Payroll taxes on claimed tips
- Workers comp on tips
- Tip credit complications
Real cost: $8-12/hour anyway
```

### Managing the Tip Float

```
THE $5,000 YOU NEED BUT DON'T HAVE

Daily Average Tip Payout:
Monday-Thursday: $600/night = $2,400
Friday: $1,500
Saturday: $1,800  
Sunday: $1,200
WEEKLY TOTAL: $6,900

But CC deposits lag 2-3 days...
So you need $5,000+ in float ALWAYS

Where to Keep It:
□ Separate "Tip Float" savings account
□ Transfer daily to checking
□ NEVER touch for other expenses
□ Build up $1,000/month until covered
```

## The 10 Commandments of Restaurant Cash Flow

1. **Thou Shalt Check Cash Daily**
   Not weekly. Not when worried. DAILY.

2. **Thou Shalt Not Trust the P&L**
   Profit ≠ Cash. Ever.

3. **Thou Shalt Keep 21 Days of Cash**
   Minimum. 30 is better. 45 is sleeping well.

4. **Thou Shalt Never Surprise Payroll**
   Miss payroll once, lose your team forever.

5. **Thou Shalt Track the Float**
   Credit cards aren't cash for 3 days.

6. **Thou Shalt Reserve for Equipment**
   It will break. At the worst time.

7. **Thou Shalt Negotiate Everything**
   Every term, every rate, every payment.

8. **Thou Shalt Build Multiple Scenarios**
   Hope for the best, plan for reality.

9. **Thou Shalt Share the Numbers**
   Your managers need to know.

10. **Thou Shalt Not Borrow from Tips**
    That's not your money. Ever.

## Expert Tips from the Trenches

💡 **"Thursday Tells the Truth"**
By Thursday, you know if the week works. Don't wait until Monday to react.

💡 **"Gift Cards are Gold"**
Push them hard in December, they'll save you in January.

💡 **"The 3 AM Rule"**
If cash keeps you up at 3 AM, you're already too late. Fix it at 3 PM.

💡 **"Vendors are Partners"**
Until you miss two payments. Then they're bill collectors.

💡 **"Tips are Sacred"**
Borrow from vendors, not servers. Trust dies fast.

💡 **"Equipment Has Feelings"**
Ignore maintenance, pay for replacement.

💡 **"Cash is Oxygen"**
You can survive 3 minutes without it. Maybe 4. Not 5.
